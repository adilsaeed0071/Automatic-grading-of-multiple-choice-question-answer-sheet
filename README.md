# Automatic-grading-of-multiple-choice-question-answer-sheet
A method is proposed using the computer vision techniques for the grading of MCQ answer sheet which is focused on not using the black marker on answer sheet. The system will automatically detect the answer area and rows and column will be detected automatically by using the extracted ROIs. The extracted ROIs are taken as those circles that are detected using Hough transform. System will also detect the number of questions and the sequence on the answer sheet. The question number detection is done through the Optical Character Recognition (OCR). These all techniques will help in making the system more flexible and adaptable in comparison of fixed structure sheet designs. The accuracy of system in extracting ROI is 100%. While the accuracy of recognising the question number on answer sheet is 99.34 %. The system is checked on total 26 samples. The samples have different rows and columns and do not have any black annotation on them. In the samples there are 20 sheet having the 60 question in it and 6 sheets have 54 question on it
